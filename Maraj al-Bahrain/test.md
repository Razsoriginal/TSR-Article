Maraj al-Bahrain

Apparent meaning:
Surah Rehman 19: He has made the two oceans meet each other
Agha Ali Puya: Refer to Furqan: 53 and Fatir: 12.

Surah Furqa 53: It is He who has joined the two seas; one palatable and sweet, the other bitterly salty and has established a barrier between them as a partition.
[Pooya/Ali Commentary 25:53] Barzakh is used here as in verse 100 of Al Muminun - a barrier between two extremes. Aqa Mahdi Puya says: It may also refer to the spiritual and the physical or good and bad currents or courses in the process of existence with a distinguished medium (a barrier) between them which prevents the mixing or intermingling of the two.

Surah Fatir 12: The two oceans, one sweet and the other salty, are not alike. From each you can eat fresh meat and obtain ornaments to use. You see ships ploughing their way through them so that you may seek His favor and give Him thanks.
[Pooya/Ali Commentary 35:12] Man is required to differentiate between good and evil, as these two opposites can never be combined in one person. There is an indirect hint, or even a taunt here, for those who profess belief, and yet love those who disbelieve. Taking guidance from this verse no one could compare the holy Ahl ul Bayt, who have been thoroughly purified by Allah (Ahzab: 33), to the others who have been polluted by a sinful and corrupt life. Many of those others, even after embracing Islam outwardly, were not believers, because faith had not entered their hearts. (Hujurat: 14).

Surah Rehman 20: but has created a barrier between them so that they will not merge totally.
[Pooya/Ali Commentary 55:20] Aqa Mahdi Puya says: According to the Ahl ul Bayt the two streams refer to nabuwwah (prophethood) and imamah (divinely commissioned guides) which flow together and yet with a distinguishing line between them, assigning separate functions to each of them, so as not to create confusion. The Holy Prophet is the most perfect manifestation of nabuwwah and Ali is the most perfect manifestation of wilayah or imamah, and Fatimah is the distinguishing line between them which connects both of them. According to a tradition related by Salman Farsi, Ibn Jubayr and Sufyan Sawri recorded by Ibn Marduwayh and Jalal al Din al Suyuti the two oceans are Ali and Fatimah and the Holy Prophet is the link between them, Hasan and Husayn are the pearls.

Surah Rehman 22: From the two oceans comes pearls and coral.
Surah Rehman 24: By His command, the ships with raised masts sail on the sea like mountains.

One interpretation:
One of the dreaded stages of the hereafter is ‘Barzakh’. ‘Barzakh’ literally means a curtain or a separation, which lies between two things and does not allow them to meet each other. For example, sweet water and bitter water both flow side by side, but Almighty Allah has set between them a barrier so they do not intermingle. As Allah says in the Qur’an,

“He has made the two seas to flow freely (So that) they meet together” (Surah ar-Rahman, 55:19).

“Between them is a barrier which they cannot pass” (Surah ar-Rahman, 55:20).

But Barzakh in this context means that Allah has placed a curtain between this world and the hereafter. Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq (‘a) says, “By Allah! I fear a lot for your state in Barzakh.” The narrator asked Imam (‘a) as to what was Barzakh? Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq (‘a) replied that, it is a period starting from death till Qiyamah. (Bihar al-Anwar)

“And before them is a barrier (Barzakh) until the day they are raised” (Surah al-Mu’minoon, 23:100).

Another interpretation:
19. He let loose the two salty and sweet seas meeting together.
20. Between them is a barrier so that none of them can transgress.
21. Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both [jinn and men] deny?

The Arabic verbal form maraja designates:

"let loose"

and the Arabic noun barzakh denotes "a barrier between two things." Resuming the account of Divine Blessings mention is made of seas, but not all seas. The particular quality of certain seas is an astonishing phenomenon serving as a token of Divine Absolute Omnipotence. It also serves as a means of producing certain things used by men.

Thus, the blessed Verses are saying that He juxtaposed two different seas while they meet; however, there is a barrier between the twain such that one may not agitate and prevail over the other.

As it is reflected elsewhere in the Glorious Qur’an, the twain seas are the salty and the sweet seas:

"And it is He Who let loose the two seas: one palatable and sweet and the other salty and bitter and He set a barrier and a complete partition between them"19.

Qur’anic exegetes disagree as to the location of the two sweet and salty seas and the fact that one does not prevail the other and the nature of the barrier separating the twain.

However, mention was already made of the point in the exegesis of Chapter 25 saying that great sweet rivers flowing into seas and oceans usually form a sea of sweet water beside the coast thus repelling the brine and it would be of interest to know that sweet and salty water, owing to the difference in the degrees of thickness, do not intermingle.

A bird's eye view of discrete salty and sweet waters clearly shows the partition between the twain. When the margins of the twain intermingle, fresh sweet water substitutes the mingled waters, such that the partition between the twain is visible at all times. It is interesting that at the time of flow, the level of oceans is raised, such that sweet water is repelled without being intermingled with the brine.

The blessed Verse 21 is again addressed to God's servants inquiring:

"Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both [jinn and men] deny?"

Surah al-Rahman - Verses 22-23
يَخْرُجُ مِنْهُمَا اللُّؤْلُؤُ وَالْمَرْجَانُ

فَبِأيِّ آلَآء رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ

22. Out of both seas come out pearl and coral.
23. Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both [jinn and men] deny?

Resuming the account of Divine Blessings, the blessed Verse 22 is saying that pearl and coral come out of the twain seas. It is worthy of note that interesting adornments are made of pearl and coral. They are also used in medical treatments and they constitute commodities and merchandise as well. Many benefits are accrued out of them. Thus, they are being referred to as two Blessings.

Pearls are transparent and precious things fostered in mothers of pearl in the depth of the seas. The larger they are, the more precious they become. They are also used in many medical treatments. Former physicians made different potions out of them for strengthening the heart, the nervous system and warding off different kinds of breathing ailments, fear, kidney and eye complications, bad breath, kidney and bladder stones, and jaundice.20

Coral is herein interpreted by some exegetes as small pearl, but such interpretation is far from being true. It is an animate being similar to a twig growing in the depth of seas. It was regarded by scientists for some time to be a kind of plant, but later on it became evident that it belongs to the animal world. It sticks to the bottom of the sea and at times covers a vast area to increase in time and form coral islands.

The best kind of coral is red in color and the redder, the more precious it is. Besides serving as adornment, it is applied in medicine and many benefits have been enumerated for the same. Instances of its medical applications include potions made from it which are sued for strengthening the heart, removal of viper's venom, strengthening of the nervous system, treatment of diarrhea and womb bleeding. It is also said that it is useful for treatment of epilepsy.

The following Verse further emphasizes on Divine Blessings saying:

"Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both [jinn and men] deny?"

A tradition narrated from Imam Sadiq (as) regarding the exegesis of the blessed Verse:

"He let loose the two salty and sweet seas meeting together,"

according to which:

"‘Ali and Fatima (as) are two deep seas, none of the twain transgresses the other out of the twain seas pearl and coral, namely Hasan and Husayn (as) came out."21

The same point is also attested in Tafsir al-Manthur22. It may be attested in most of Shi‘i exegetic works, e.g. Tabarsi's Majma‘ al-Bayan and also in Tafsir Burhan, Tafsir Nur al-Thiqalayn, Tafsir Safi, and also in some of Sunni exegetic works with slight variations.

However, it is known that the Glorious Qur’an has different layers thereby one single Verse may have several or tens of meanings. The content of the aforesaid tradition derives from Qur’anic layers and is not inconsistent with the literal meaning of the same.

Qur'anic Verse . Surat al-Rahman
In regards to Quranic verses 55:19 and 20, it mentions the creation of two seas and a barrier preventing them from mixing. However, it has been scientifically proven that they mix in minuscule amounts. How can this be explained?

Mixing in minuscule amount is itself a miracle as huge pressure from water from both sides should make full mixing between the two seas, but Allah Created barrier preventing full mixing despite the huge amounts of water from both seas. This a living miracle witnessed and admitted by scientists. Such barrier between millions of tons of waters from two seas can never be created by human beings.

Another interpretation:
Verses 20-22
The Holy Prophet said: “The meeting of the Two Seas indicates the matrimonial union between ‘Ali and
Fatimah and the ‘Barzakh’. i.e., the Barrier between the Two Seas is the Holy Prophet and the coming
out of the Pearl and Coral - Hasan and Husayn.” This is the report of Ibn Mardwaih, Ibn Abbas, Anas
Ibn Malik27 (M.S.).
This is true of many geographical flowing of the seas with the barrier between them but it also
f
iguratively has been applied by the Imams of the Ahl Al-Bayt to the two Streams of ‘Nubuwwah’,
Prophethood, and ‘Wilayah’ which flew together and yet with distinctive barriers preventing the two
divine functions from encroaching on each other creating any confusion.
In this figurative sense, it has been applied to the Holy Prophet as the most perfect manifestation of
Prophethood and to ‘Ali as the most perfect manifestation of ‘Wilayah’ taking Fatimah as the Barrier and
the connecting link between.
According to other traditions from Salman al-Farsi and Syed Ibn Jubair and Sofyan Sauri the two
oceans mean ‘Ali and Fatimah and the Barrier is the Holy Prophet and the outcome the pearls and
corals: Hasan and Husayn (A.P.).
It may refer to the geographical ones or in figurative sense, meaning the offsprings of the Holy Prophet
and ‘Ali (A.P.)
